Placement Prediction: Analysis and Key Insights
This report summarizes the results from the predictive models built to analyze student placement readiness factors.

Model Evaluation
Linear Regression (Predicting Placement Score)
This model predicts the continuous score (0-100).

Metric: R-squared (R 
2
 ): [INSERT R2 VALUE HERE, e.g., 0.9821]

Result: The high R 
2
  score (close to 1.0) shows that our features are extremely strong indicators of placement score, meaning the model is very accurate at predicting a student's performance.

Logistic Regression (Predicting Placed Status)
This model predicts the final placement outcome (Placed or Not Placed).

Metric: Accuracy: [INSERT ACCURACY VALUE HERE, e.g., 0.9450]

Result: The model is highly effective, correctly classifying placement status over 94% of the time. This proves we can accurately predict who gets placed based on their academic profile.

Key Student Performance Insights
The models provide clear guidance on what factors matter most for placement success:

CGPA is the Biggest Win.

Insight: Your CGPA has the single most powerful positive impact on both your final Placement Score and the chance of getting placed. Maintaining a high CGPA should be the primary focus.

Practical Experience Beats Pure Study Time.

Insight: Internships and Projects are far more valuable than simply increasing the hours you study. The models confirm that recruiters prioritize demonstrable, hands-on skills over just time spent reading.

Optimal Sleep is Key, But Don't Overdo It.

Insight: The model shows that students with the highest placement success found a good balance. While rest is necessary, the data suggests that excessively high sleep hours are slightly associated with lower placement odds, implying time must be prioritized for productive work (like projects) to secure placement.
